This program explores Cornelis de Jager’s “charming theory” of personalized physical constants, as described in John Allen Paulos’s Irreligion. 
The user selects a constant μ (e.g., π, e, or a physical measurement) and four personal numbers. 
The program then applies the de Jager formula
wᵃ · xᵇ · yᶜ · zᵈ
where a, b, c, and d are chosen from a fixed set of exponents.
By testing all combinations, it finds the closest approximation to μ, reports the best exponents, the resulting value, and the relative error.
This demonstrates how surprisingly close (or far) de Jager’s formula can come to matching real-world constants.
